<h1>History behind skincare </h1>
<br> 
<br> 
<P> Skincare is a very imporant rituale in our every day lives. The first recorded proof of a skincare routine was found Egypt in 3000 BCE. Cleopatrea was known to bathe in sour milk to sooth her skin. They also used sand and aloe vera to exfoliate. In the 1800s, light skin was the beauty standard, so women would use mixtures of zinc oxide and lemon juice to brighten their complextions. Skincare will always will be a routine that many humans will partake in, until the death of humanity.
